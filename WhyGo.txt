Why GoLang?
- It seems Interesting how Go has came into picture of Coding world..! 

Talking about Go when the language was developed, the world revolved around 3 major languages. 
1. C/C++
2. Java 
3. Python 

Now, seeing the nature of these three languages, Google saw there were issues from wach of these o=languages, when it comes to C/C++ these languages have always have a problem with its slow compliation times,as we move forward into the future the time will eventually increase as a result of various old code and to maintain the legacy. 
On the other hand when it comes to Python, python is a interpreted language, which is easy to write but always too slow, it takes quite a time to complile. Not just being slow there were alwas chances to have various breakdown during active and high use of the language. 
Then coming to Java, it has been the great language in quite a about of time, but the drawback thaken from Java was with time this language became too complex to understand ad study.

Now apart from all these when we talk about Go when it came into picture, There was no language supporting Multi threading, apart from that Google wanted to have a language to support multi thrading, which is not too complex and easy to understand and a system level language. 

So, Go eventually came into picture.
